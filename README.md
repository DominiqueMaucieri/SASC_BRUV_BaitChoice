# SASC BRUV BaitChoice

This R script and data is in collaboration with the South African Shark Conservancy (https://www.sharkconservancy.org/) and invistigates the effect of various bait types on community assemblages recorded on baited remote underwater video (BRUV) systems.

## Welcome to my R code. 
It is a self sustaining code, so new data can be added to the bruv data set and the code can be run and it will take the new data and incorporate it if there are issues with code (any error messages, data not meeting the assumptions of normality) please contact me

BRUV_master.xlsx
  - is the data sheet containing the analized BRUV data
 
R Code_BRUV Paper.R
  - this is the R script used for the bait choice analysis
  
ClassData folder
  - contains all the data files that are used and produced when the R script is run

I have annotated my code a bit, there will be some places you need to fill in things so it will run on your computer, so make sure you give it a read

I hope it runs smoothly for you
